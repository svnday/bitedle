# Bitedle 💣✓

A daily game of nerve, Wordle-style. Somewhere on a 5×5 board hides **one green
check mark** — find it in as few clicks as you can. But 3 to 5 **bombs** are
hiding too, and one wrong click ends your day.

## Rules

- Click a tile to reveal it:
  - **✗ (red X)** — a safe miss, keep going.
  - **💣 (bomb)** — game over, counts as a loss.
  - **✓ (check mark)** — you win!
- Your score is the number of clicks it took to find the check. Lower is
  better; 1 is perfection.
- There is exactly **one** check mark and **3–5 bombs** (the exact count is
  hidden) — every other tile is a miss.
- A new board is generated every day at midnight. Everyone plays the **same
  board**, and each player gets **one game per day**.
- No sign-in: play immediately, and after your first game pick a display
  name for the leaderboard (rename anytime from the header chip). Skipping
  the name keeps your results **off the leaderboards** until you pick one —
  personal stats still work. Everything follows you via an anonymous browser
  cookie.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # development, http://localhost:3000
```

or for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## How it works

- **Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4.**
- The daily board is derived from a **secret + the date**
  ([src/lib/game.ts](src/lib/game.ts)), and the API only reveals the cells you
  have clicked — so the layout can't be peeked at from the client. The secret
  comes from the `BITEDLE_SECRET` env var (a fixed dev value is used locally).
- The day flips at **midnight in `BITEDLE_TZ`** (default `America/New_York`)
  for everyone, regardless of where the player or server is
  ([src/lib/time.ts](src/lib/time.ts)); the API tells the client exactly when
  the next board drops.
- Storage is behind a small interface ([src/lib/store.ts](src/lib/store.ts)):
  **Neon/Postgres** when `DATABASE_URL` is set (tables are auto-created on
  first request), otherwise a local JSON file at `data/db.json` for
  zero-setup development.
- API routes ([src/app/api/](src/app/api/)): `state`, `click`, `name`,
  `stats`, `leaderboard`. Identity is an anonymous id in an httpOnly cookie,
  auto-created on first visit ([src/lib/identity.ts](src/lib/identity.ts));
  the display name is just a label, so duplicates are allowed and the
  leaderboard marks your own rows server-side. Clearing cookies (or switching
  browsers) starts a fresh player — streaks don't follow you across devices.

## Deploying (Vercel + Neon)

1. Push this repo to GitHub (already at `svnday/bitedle`).
2. On [vercel.com](https://vercel.com), **Import Project** → pick the repo.
   Next.js is auto-detected; no build settings needed.
3. Add the **Neon integration** (Vercel Marketplace → Neon, or create the
   database at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech) and copy its connection
   string). Either way, the project needs a `DATABASE_URL` environment
   variable.
4. Add a `BITEDLE_SECRET` environment variable: any long random string
   (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`). Set it once and never change it —
   it defines the daily boards.
5. Optionally set `BITEDLE_TZ` if you want the daily reset somewhere other
   than US Eastern midnight.
6. Deploy. The database schema is created automatically on the first
   request — no migration step.

To develop against the real database locally, copy `.env.example` to
`.env.local` and fill in `DATABASE_URL`; without it, dev mode uses the JSON
file.
